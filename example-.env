# This is an example configuration file. 
# Make a copy of this file, and name it ".env"
# (This will hide the file from `ls`, but you can still see it using `ls -a`)
# Remember that you can always raise a github issue if you'd like help.

# If you'd like to set any of these as environment variables, that will also work.
